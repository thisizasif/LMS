# LMS
LOAN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
To clone the repository in Termux and create a README.md file, you can follow these steps. Assuming you have Git installed in your Termux environment:

1. Open Termux.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, if you want to clone it in your home directory:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

3. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thisizasif/LMS
    ```

4. Change into the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd LMS
    ```

5. Create a README.md file using a text editor like Nano. You can install Nano if it's not already installed:

    ```bash
    pkg install nano
    ```

    Then, create and edit the README.md file:

    ```bash
    nano README.md
    ```

6. Inside Nano, you can add content to your README.md file. For example:

    ```markdown
    # Loan Management System

    This repository contains a simple command-line loan management system implemented in Python.

    ## Features

    - Option to make a loan
    - Option to make a payment
    - Option to view loan statement
    - Option to view account details

    ## How to Run

    1. Install Python on your system.
    2. Open Termux and navigate to the cloned directory.
    3. Run the main.py script:

        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```

    ...

    ```

    You can add more information about how to use the system, any dependencies, or any other relevant details.

7. Save and exit the text editor (in Nano, press `Ctrl` + `X`, then press `Y` to confirm saving changes, and press `Enter`).

Now you have cloned the repository and created a README.md file. Adjust the content of README.md to fit your needs and provide instructions for running the loan management system.
